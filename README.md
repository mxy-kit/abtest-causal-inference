# A/B Testing and Causal Inference Experiments

This repository contains my experiments in **sequential A/B testing** and **causal inference** methods.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### 1. Sequential A/B Testing
Applied **Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)** and **mSPRT** to analyze conversion rates in an online shop experiment.  
- Dataset: web conversion logs (users, groups, cities)  
- Goal: evaluate whether a new page design leads to higher conversion rates compared to the old design  
- Methods: sequential testing, hypothesis evaluation, visualization of test statistics

### 2. Causal Inference on Tips Dataset
Studied whether **smokers leave larger tips** than non-smokers using the classic `tips` dataset.  
- Dataset: restaurant tips (bill, tip, gender, smoking status)  
- Goal: evaluate treatment effect of smoking status on tips  
- Methods: propensity score matching, group comparison, visualization
